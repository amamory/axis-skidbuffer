If this design has custom IPs, then this dir would have directories to each custom IPs 
linked to the IPs source repository (i.e. it's a git submodule dir). 

If this design is a custom IP, then this dir would have a directory with the IP's 
component.xml file to recreate the IP's Vivado design for IP edition.  

Dont place any other dir or file here.
