This directory is a place holder for the Vivado projects. These projects are not supposed to 
be under version control and will be discarded. Save anything relevant to the design. 
It is useful to export the TCL of the design to get its configuration. This can be done in 
Vivado's GUI via File -> Project -> Write TCL ...

Dont place any other dir or file here. the .gitignore file deliberately ignores anything 
inside this directory
